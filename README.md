Real‑time Live Alerts for Twitch & Kick  
Never miss a moment.

Stream Notifier is a lightweight, floating utility that lets you monitor the live status of your favorite Twitch and Kick streamers from any tab in your browser. It stays out of the way until you need it — then expands into a powerful dashboard with previews, filters, profiles, and customization options.

## 🚀 Install the Extension

**Chrome Web Store:**  
👉 _Coming soon — pending review_

## ⭐ Key Features

### Universal Overlay  
A persistent, draggable “Streamers” button that expands into a dashboard — check who’s live without leaving your current website.

### Streamer Lists & Favorites  
Add streamers manually or auto‑detect them from the page you’re on. Mark favorites to pin them to the top.

### Live Previews  
Preview stream audio or even watch a live Kick iframe preview directly inside the dashboard.

### Custom Profiles  
Create multiple profiles (e.g., Gaming, Work, Late Night) and switch between them instantly.

### Excluded Domains  
Hide the floating button on specific websites using domain or URL‑pattern exclusions.

### Smart Notifications  
Desktop notifications with cooldown logic to avoid spam when streams restart.

### Deep Customization  
Dark mode, holiday themes, custom accent colors, simplified UI mode, adjustable opacity, and more.

### Privacy‑Focused  
All data — streamers, profiles, settings — is stored locally on your device.  
No external servers. No tracking. No analytics.
